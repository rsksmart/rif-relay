## Project structure

The project is divided into multiple modules that interact with each other.
Each project has its own documentation in its repository.

## Committing changes

To contribute to the project, create a branch with the name of the new feature you are implementing (e.g. `gas-optimization`). When you commit to git, a hook is executed. The hook executes a linter and all the tests.
