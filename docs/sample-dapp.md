# How to use the RIF Relay Sample dApp SDK

## Getting Started

This guide helps to quickly get started with setting up your environment to use RIF Relay and also use the sample dApp to test relay services.

### Step 1: Run the Rootstock node

You need to set up and run a Rootstock node, preferably the latest version from RSKj releases. The node can operate locally or via Docker. In either case, a [`node.conf`](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-relay/blob/main/docker/node.conf) file is used.

Refer to the [Rootstock Node Installation Guide](/node-operators/setup/installation/) for a detailed guide on this step.


### Step 2: Add network to Metamask

To interact with the Rootstock network, you need to add it to Metamask. Since we're using the node on `--regtest mode`, follow the Metatmask guide on [How to add a custom network RPC](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC) and add the Rootstock RegTest  Network to Metamask with the following data:

```text
- Network name: RSK regtest
- New RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:4444
- Chain ID: 33
- Currency symbol: tRBTC
```

To learn more about Metatmask and how to add it to Rootstock programmatically, see [Metamask](/dev-tools/wallets/metamask/) and [How to add Metamask to Rootstock Programmatically](/resources/tutorials/rootstock-metamask/).


### Step 3: Set up RIF Relay contracts

To set up RIF relay contract, clone the RIF Relay Contracts Repository: https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-relay-contracts, then follow the [RIF Relay Deployment](/developers/integrate/rif-relay/deployment/) guide to deploy an RIF Relay contract, enable revenue sharing, and whitelist the token by allowing it.

    <Accordion.Body>
        - To mint new units of the `UtilToken` into the Metamask wallet address:
        - Go to the Metamask wallet, and copy the wallet address:
        - Execute the command to mint the token, where:
            - `--token-address` → this is the address for `UtilToken`
            - `--amount` → quantity to be minted
            - `--receiver` → wallet address
            ```bash
            npx hardhat mint \
            --token-address 0x6f217dEd6c86A57f1211F464302e6fA544045B4f \
            --amount 10000000000000000000 \
            --receiver <wallet-address> \
            --network regtest 
            ```
        - Import the minted token into the wallet.
        - To see the token in the wallet, click on “import tokens”, and then paste the token address.

### Step 4: Set up RIF Relay Server

Clone the [RIF Relay Server Repository](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-relay-server), then refer to [Run the RIF Relay Server](/developers/integrate/rif-relay/deployment#run-the-rif-relay-server) for a complete guide on setting up the RIF Relay server.


## RIF Relay Sample dApp

This sample dApp shows you how to send transactions to the Rootstock blockchain using the [RIF Relay Sample dApp SDK](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-relay-sample-dapp). You'll need to connect the dApp with MetaMask for signing transactions with the account managing your Smart Wallets.

### Clone SDK repository and install dependencies

```bash
    # clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/relaying-services-sdk-dapp
    cd relaying-services-sdk-dapp
    # install dependencies
    npm install --force
```
- Configure environment variables

Create a new file named `.env`  in the top directory, and add the following lines in it (with the contract addresses generated when we deployed the contracts) in the **Set up RIF Relay Contracts** section above:
        
```bash
    REACT_APP_CONTRACTS_RELAY_HUB=0x463F29B11503e198f6EbeC9903b4e5AaEddf6D29
    REACT_APP_CONTRACTS_DEPLOY_VERIFIER=0x14f6504A7ca4e574868cf8b49e85187d3Da9FA70

### Run the dApp

```bash
    # run app in regtest environment
    ENV_VALUE="regtest" npm run start
```
![Run the dApp](/img/rif-relay/starter-kit/run-the-dapp.png)

- Connect metamask wallet for signing

![Connect Metamask Wallet](/img/rif-relay/starter-kit/connect-metamask-wallet.png)
- Create a new smart wallet

- Mint tokens to the wallet
    - For commands to mint token, See step 6 in the Set up RIF Relay contracts section above.
