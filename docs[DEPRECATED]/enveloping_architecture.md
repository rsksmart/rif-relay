# Enveloping architecture

The system is designed to achieve deployments and transaction sponsorship at a low cost. The cost of the relay service provided by "sponsors" is agreed upon among the parties off-chain. The low cost of transactions on RSK contributes to keeping overall service costs low as well.

The core Enveloping architecture is defined by the following components:

-   **Relay Request** - a structure that wraps the transaction sent by an end-user. It includes data required for relaying the trasaction e.g. address of the payer, address of the original requester, token payment data.
-   **Deploy Request** - a structure that wraps the transaction sent to deploy a Smart wallet.
-   **Relay Hub** - a core contract which serves as the interface for the on-chain part of the system. It manages the balances of the accounts involved and forwards Relays Requests to the rest of the contracts.
-   **Relay Verifier** - an abstract contract that authorizes a specific relay request.
-   **Deploy Verifier** - an abstract contract that authorizes a specific deploy request.
-   **Smart Wallet** - a contract that verifies forwarded data and subsequently invokes the recipient contract of the transaction. The smart wallet is deployed _counterfactually_ at the moment it is needed. This happens, for instance, when a user with some token balances wants to move those tokens without spending gas, i.e. using the enveloping system.
-   **Relay Server** - a relay service daemon, running as an HTTP service. Advertises itself (through the Relay Hub) and waits for client requests.
-   **Relay Client** - a typescript library for a client to access the blockchain through a relay. Provides APIs to find a relay, and to send transactions through it.
