# Development guide

## Initializing the project

To use Enveloping, follow these [steps](../docs/launching_enveloping.md) to build the project.

## Project structure

The project has on-chain and off-chain components.

-   The `contracts` directory in the root directory, contains all the smart contracts involved in Enveloping.
    -   These can be compiled with `yarn prepare`. The changes will be reflected in the `build/contracts`.
    -   If a new contract is created, it is important to add it to `migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js` for deploying it.
    -   The solidity version used currently is `^0.6.12`.
-   The `src` directory contains the off-chain components such as `cli`, `relayclient` and `relayserver`. Everything here is coded in `typescript`.
    -   To compile these typescript files, use `yarn tsc`. The changes will appear in the `dist` directory.
-   The `jsrelay` directory contains files for running a Relay Server. See [here](docs/launching_enveloping.md) for more details.
-   `test` contains the test suite. See section below to learn how to test Enveloping.

## Testing

When adding new tests, we should compile them first (with `yarn tsc`) before running them.

-   To run all the tests:

`./run-tests.sh`

Note: The script will start an RSK node in regtest mode and then run all the tests. So it takes some time to run the tests. You need to have `curl` in order to run it.

-   To run a specific test:

Once the project is built, we can test it with truffle
`yarn generate && npx truffle test --network rsk test/Flows.test.ts` (with [truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/))

## Committing changes

To contribute to the project, create a branch with the name of the new feature you are implementing (e.g. `gas-optimization`). When you commit to git, a hook is executed. The hook executes a linter and all the tests.

## Troubleshooting <a id="c07"></a>

### Common errors when testing

#### Running a test throws the Error: Cannot find module 'directory-to-the-project/enveloping/rsknode/test/Flows.test.ts'

Ensure that you are in the project's root directory and that the test's name has no typos

#### Running Flows.test.ts test throws the error: http://localhost:8095 => Error: local view call to 'relayCall()' reverted: view call to 'relayCall'..

Stop the running node and delete the db used by the node.

#### Running some test and one of them throws: Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8095

The relay server running in the background. Run the bash file `scripts/kill-relay-server.sh`
